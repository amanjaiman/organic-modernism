# ðŸŒ¿ Organic Modernism Design System Roadmap

## Overview
A comprehensive design system that blends natural harmony with modern precision, built for professional startup applications.

## ðŸŽ¨ Design Philosophy: "Organic Modernism"

### Core Principles
1. **Organic Geometry** - Natural shapes meet precise geometric elements
2. **Layered Depth** - Subtle shadows and layering without heaviness
3. **Tactile Elements** - Components feel textured and weighted
4. **Breathing Space** - Generous spacing for luxury feel
5. **Micro-interactions** - Organic, responsive animations

### Visual Language
- **Rounded Corners**: 12px, 16px, 24px scale
- **Shadows**: Soft, layered elevation
- **Gradients**: Subtle, natural color transitions
- **Animations**: 300ms ease-out transitions
- **Scaling**: 1.02x hover, 0.98x active states

5. **Documentation**: Live examples and usage guidelines

### Technical Architecture
- **Framework**: React + TypeScript
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS with custom design tokens
- **Testing**: Jest + React Testing Library
- **Storybook**: Component documentation and testing
- **Build**: Vite for fast development and building

### Design Tokens Structure
